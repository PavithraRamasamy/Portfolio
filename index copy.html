                    <li><b>Duration:</b> Fall 2017 - Team Project</li><br>
                    <li><b>Course:</b> Introduction to Human Computer Interaction</li><br>

                  </ul><br>
                  <p class="processflow">In our Introduction to HCI course, we were split into teams of 4 and given a common topic - <strong> Engaging Communities </strong> - to base our semester long project upon. While brainstorming on which community to focus on our project, all of us collectively decided to design solutions that deal with issues faced by elementary school kids in their education.</p> <br>
                  <p class="headers"><strong>Motivation</strong></p>
                  <p class="processflow">Our team project is based on improving kid’s education in elementary schools through interactive learning systems. Our main motivation for choosing this project is that we observed that the kids were having great difficulty focusing on learning the materials provided in class as they were not engaged or motivated enough. 
                  <p class="headers"><strong>Project Goals</strong></p>
                  <p class="processflow">Through this project, we attempt to address the problem of student distraction and lack of interest while dealing with topics of difficulty. We mainly focus on the following aspects in our project- </p>
                  <ul class="inline">
                  	<li>Making kids motivated and engaged in learning the curriculum through interactive systems</li>
                  	<li>Bring about better Parents-Kids engagement in their kid's education</li>
                  	<li>Better Parent-Teacher communication systems for both the sides to be aware of the kid's progress.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p class="headers"><strong>Our Process</strong></p>
                  <p class="processflow">The approach that we took to design this project is divided into five phases - Design Problem, Brainstorming, Analysis, Prototyping and Evaluation.</p> 
                  <img src="img/DesignProcess.png" alt="">
                  <p class="processflow"><strong>Design Problem</strong></p>
                  <p class="processflow-1">On observing a coding classroom for the elementary school kids at the Washington Cathay Pacific Center, we noticed that the kids were
focussed on moving up through the levels in the game based learning exercise but were not keen on looking into the javascript code that followed it. We also noticed that the students were demotivated and were not finding the exercises engaging.<br><br>The lead causes for the kid’s lack of interest are the difficulty of the materials, different interests based on their genders, the presentation of the learning materials, and the different adaptability rates.</p>
				  <q class="processflow problem-quote"> <strong> Problem: Distraction among Elementary Kids in Classrooms </strong></q>
				  <br><br><p class="processflow"><strong>Brainstorming</strong></p>
				  <p class="processflow-1">With this design problem in mind, I conducted semi-structured interviews with elementary school teachers and parents. Through these interviews, I learnt that the kids were not looking into the JavaScript code that popped up in the interface inspite of repeated instructions due to growing interest in progressing through the game-based activity rather than learning something out of it.<br> The main concern that the teachers put forth was that the students were getting anxious and less-motivated as the levels of the program became more complex and it starts to become difficult for him to bring their focus to one place. The parents mentioned that they felt the use of technology to enhance their kid's knowledge is good in a way that it helps them stay engaged, motivates and promotes healthy competition in an interactive manner. </p>
				  <q class="processflow solution-quote"> <strong> Solution: Design Engaging and Interactive Learning Experiences </strong></q><br>
				  <br><p class="processflow-1"> From our semi-structured interviews, we found the crux of the issue that the kids are facing that distracts them during classroom activities. To design creative and engaging learning experiences, we performed card sorting technique to analyse their problem in an effective manner. Followed by card sorting, each of us sketched 40 ideas and collectively gathered all of them to find out which idea would best suit the needs of our design problem.</p>
				  <img class="sketch-image" src="img/portfolio/S1.png" alt="">
				  <p class="processflow"><strong>Analysis</strong></p>
				  <p class="processflow">Post our brainstorming phase, we developed personas and scenarios to support our ideas. The personas that we developed were of kids, teachers and parents. We drew several key insights to accomodate these personas in our designs.</p>
				  <img class="analysis-image" src="img/portfolio/P1.png" alt=""><br>
				  <img class="analysis-image-2" src="img/portfolio/P2.png" alt=""><br>
				  <p class="processflow"><strong>Prototyping</strong></p>
				  <p class="processflow">For testing the developed personas and scenarios, we then developed low and high-fidelity prototypes to help understand the user experience of our tool. From the sketches that we developed, three major ideas stood out - <strong>Social Media for kids to promote knowledge transfer, Leaderboard to encourage healthy competition and Game-based learning activities to engage the kids</strong> - which we have focused on our prototypes.</p>
				  <p class="lofiprototype"><strong>Low Fidelity Prototype</strong></p>
				  <p class="lofiprototype">The purpose of this design is to provide an easy to use interface for a web based tool that will be used by elementary and middle students (ages 7 to 13) and teachers. Our main objective is to keep students engaged in the classroom and decrease distractions. We plan to do so by making students compete against each other through a real-time reward system. Students may compete with each other for bragging rights or prizes (badges, candy, etc). Teachers who manage students can create activities and assignments, grade and award points and badged, and communicate with students and parents through the platforms social media features.</p>
				  <img class="lfp-image" src="img/portfolio/lfp.png" alt="">
				  <p class="hifiprototype"><strong>High Fidelity Prototype</strong></p>
				  <p class="hifiprototype">Our high-fidelity prototype shows the various screens of our interactive tool majorly focussing on the leaderboard and game based learning approaches. We feel that the game-based learning approach gives a sense of connectedness and encouragement for the kids, whereas the leaderboard gives a sense of competitiveness that gives the kids motivation to excel in their education.</p>
				  <img class="hfp-image" src="img/portfolio/hfp1.png" alt="">
				  <img class="hfp-image-2" src="img/portfolio/hfp2.png" alt="">
				  <p class="processflow"><strong>Evaluation</strong></p>
				  <p class="processflow">With our low fidelity prototypes and high fidelity prototypes, I conducted heuristic evaluation and cognitive walkthroughs with expert users. The users commented that the tool provided an engaging and interesting way to learn, the icons were large thus being simple and easy to use for elementary kids.On the other hand, certain issues that the experts faced with our tool was that, proper feedback and current status of thetool was lacking. Also, it was mentioned that some of the buttons were also not accessible as full functionality was not included in the prototype. Finally, the experts also suggested that addition of previous screen navigation button could be very useful incases where the kid erroneously clicks on a button and there is no undo option. From all the feedback that we received through all our evaluation, we analysed and modified the high-fidelity prototype according to the feedback received.</p>
				  <p class="headers"><strong>Demo Video</strong></p>
				  <p class="processflow">To aid our design solution, we created a video prototype and animation of our interactive tool using Adobe AfterEffects.</p>

                  <p class="processflow"><strong>Visualizing Cascading Delays </strong> is a project in which a fellow classmate and I visualized the airplane dataset for the year 2007 to identify cities in which the cascading delays are maximum as well as cities in which the delays are minimum. Cascading Delays in other words is defined as the departure delay caused at the origin airport, thereby causing an arrival delay at a connecting airport which in turn causes an arrival delay at the destination airport. For example, a flight moving from NY to CA has connections at TX. If the flight is delayed by 60mins at NY, which causes a delay of 45mins at TX in turn causing a delay of 20mins when the flight arrives at CA is called as Cascading Delays. </p><br>
                  <p class="headers"><strong>Project Goals</strong></p>
                  <p class="processflow">The airplane dataset is huge and has multiple data points which makes it challenging to visualize the important features of this data. The aim of this term project is to find effective ways of visualizing this dataset such that it could help passengers select days with least delays or could enable the airport authorities to see delay patterns and make necessary changes. Also, for someone interested in studying flights in the US, these visualizations could also help gain insights into how flying patterns of people in the US have altered over time.<br>
                  The dataset contains details of all the flights within the US from 1987 to 2008. Two broad categories of data points that can be looked into are delay patterns and flying patterns.</p>
                  <p class="headers"><strong>Our Process</strong></p>
                  <p class="processflow"><strong>Discover</strong></p>
                  <p class="processflow">It is observed that cascading delays were highly frequent in the US, but there are no proper visualization methods through which the users can understand which flights to choose with minimum delay. Taking this as our problem statement, we brainstormed to identify the users and their pain points.</p>
                  <p class="lofiprototype"><strong>Target Audience or Users</strong></p>
                  <p class="lofiprototype">The target audience for this data visualization project are data analysts, airport and airlines crew, and flyers(passengers).</p>
                  <p class="lofiprototype"><strong>User Goals</strong></p>
                  <p class="lofiprototype">To view and select flights that cause minimum delays at the connecting airport due to delays in origin airport.</p>
                  <p class="lofiprototype"><strong>Questions this project answers</strong></p>
                  <p class="lofiprototype">We focus on answering two major questions through this visualization project - </p>
                  <ul class="inline-1">
                  	<li> Help users observe flying patterns as well as delay patterns in flights in the US</li>
                  	<li> Is there a pattern of delays at particular airports? </li>
                  	<li> Do delays cascade, that is do delays at one airport lead to delays at other airports? </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p class="processflow"><strong>Research</strong></p>
                  <p class="processflow">To research more on how to visualize the proposed questions using the airplane dataset, we performed an extensive literature review. Different kinds of research that has already been done on visualizing multidimensional and temporal data, visualizing airplane dataset and notions of storytelling for any data visualization project were all studied.</p>
                  <p class="processflow"><strong>Design</strong></p>
                  <p class="processflow">Post our literature review, we sketched out different ways in which we can visualize flight patterns (trends in delays and flight patterns) and cascading delays.</p>
                  <img class="data-image" src="img/portfolio/D1.png" alt="">
                  <p class="processflow"><strong>Develop</strong></p>
                  <p class="processflow">We initially started developing this visualization project with a dummy dataset to show animation of flight patterns across the US in the year 2007. The <a href="http://datamaps.github.io/" target=
                  	_blank">Datamaps</a> library was used to plot the US map and to display the flight patterns in the form of arcs. For instance, for a flight moving from MD (Maryland) to CA (California) , an animated arc is drawn starting from MD and ending at CA.</p>
                  	<img class="alpha" src="img/portfolio/alpha.png" alt="">
                  	<p class="processflow">Post visualizing flight patterns in the US, we aimed to focus on visualizing cascading delays.Using a dataset for the year 2007, we visualized two levels of delays (first level being the origin airport for the initial set of delays and the second level being the delays caused in other airports due to delays in the origin airport). The origin airport is chosen by the user from a select set of ten major states. The difference between the origin and the destination points in these arcs are distinguished by using gradients. The darker shade corresponds to the origin while the lighter shade indicates the destination state. In the first level, we chose a timeframe of 5PM to 8PM to show the delays.</p>
                  	<img class="beta" src="img/portfolio/beta-1.png" alt="">
                  	<p class="processflow">The states of flights which were delayed from the origin airports are all taken as origins for the second level and the delays they caused in the flights departing from them are visualized. An animation sequence was implemented wherein we first show the first level of delays and once that is done, we show the second level of delays(cascading delays) after that on a different map.In the second level, we chose a timeframe of 8PM to 11PM to show the cascading delays.</p>
                  	<img class="beta" src="img/portfolio/beta-2.png" alt="">
                  	<p class="processflow">We observed that the gradient mappings did not occur consistently and there were significant bugs in the visualization which were found during user testing. We incorporated all these findings in our final implementation. To give our users freedom of choosing the time frame and to observe at which timeframe the delays were maximum, we implemented a time slider and a bar chart that shows the average delays caused in the cities. The user also has the freedom to select the day of the week in which they wish to view the delay information. Once the user chooses an origin airport by clicking on a particular state(one out of the 10 major states), the two levels of delays are visualized, along with a bar chart to show average delays at a particular timeframe.The weight of each arc in the first level of delays indicates the delay minutes.Through our visualization, we help users understand flight patterns being affected due to cascading delays and find out in which states the delays are being caused maximum.</p>

                  	<p class="headers"><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p>
                    <p class="processflow">Through this visualization, we were able to identify the following -
						<ol class="processflow takeaways"><li>Cities in which the delays were maximum and minimum</li>
						<li>Average delay(in minutes)caused due to delay in origin airport.</li>
						<li>Average delay(in minutes)at other airports caused due to delay in origin airport.</li></ol></p>

                  </ul><br>
                  <p class="processflow">This project was done as part of a MOOC offered in edX by the University of Michigan. In this project, I conducted a heuristic evaluation of the discussion board hosted by edX. I analysed the discussion forum and judged its compliance with recognized usability principles penned by Jakob Nielsen. Firstly, I performed analysis of the interface based on Nielsen's heuristics, noting down the findings and violations that I came across. Then I prioritized the observations made on the interface based on their severity ratings ranging from 0 (not a usability problem) to 4 (usability catastrophe). </p><br>
                  <p class="headers"><strong> Introduction</strong></p>
                  <p class="processflow">edX is an online learning platform that hosts courses with weekly learning sequences where each sequence has interactive short videos followed by quizzes and assignments for the student (course taker). The quizzes and assignments help the students to identify their stance and test their understanding once they have finished viewing the weekly lecture. The courses also include references that can be used to study further and gain more intellect on the topic of the lecture. edX also hosts a discussion forum for each course where the student can post and review questions and involve in discussions among their peers as well as the teaching assistants.</p>
                  <p class="headers"><strong> Findings and Recommendations</strong></p>
                  <p class="processflow"><strong>Finding 1.</strong> No provision to change font, text size and color of text which is included in other popularly used text editors in the “Add a Post” screen. <strong>Recommendation:</strong> Add feature to change font, text size and color of text to give the user control and freedom of what they want to do.<br><br>

					<strong>Finding 2.</strong> “Post Anonymously” option in the “Add a Post” screen not working according to its concept. <strong>Recommendation:</strong> Fix the post anonymously option such that it does not display the name of the person who is posting in the forum.<br><br>

					<strong>Finding 3.</strong> The “Blockquote” formatting option in the “Add a Post” screen merely indents the text instead of showing it as a quote. <strong>Recommendation:</strong>  When the user clicks on the blockquote option, it should show the text as a quote.<br><br>

					<strong>Finding 4.</strong> Widely used text editors use the shortcut “CTRL + U” to underline text. In the discussion forum, it is used to display the text as unordered lists which kind of brings a lag between the system and the real world. <strong>Recommendation:</strong> Try using any other shortcut to bring about unordered lists in the editor box.<br><br>

					<strong>Finding 5.</strong> No confirmation message upon submitting the post to the forum. <strong>Recommendation:</strong>  Keep the user informed from time to time regarding the status of the system.<br><br>

					<strong>Finding 6.</strong> Search results do not highlight the word being searched. <strong>Recommendation:</strong> Add a word highlight option to indicate the word being searched so that the user will know exactly where to look.<br><br>

					<strong>Finding 7.</strong> While using ordered and unordered list, every time we add an item to the list we need to choose the respective formatting option. <strong>Recommendation:</strong> Let the user use the unordered and ordered lists continuously until they opt out of that formatting option.<br><br>

					<strong>Finding 8.</strong> While there is an option to post anonymously, there is no option to respond anonymously. <strong>Recommendation:</strong> Add the option of responding to a post anonymously in order to bring about consistency within the system.<br><br>

					<strong>Finding 9.</strong> There is no option to vote on the comments made on responses to the post, whereas there is an option of voting on the responses as well as the post. <strong>Recommendation:</strong> Add the option of voting on the comments made on the responses to a post to bring about consistency within the system.<br><br>

					<strong>Finding 10.</strong> Every post has an option of voting – upvote or downvote. The upvote is indicated by a plus sign. Whenever a post has been upvoted, the color of the button changes to green, but the plus sign still remains. <strong>Recommendation:</strong> To increase the aesthetic aspect of the button, upon upvoting the symbol can be changed to show the minus sign to indicate to the user that they can reverse their action.<br><br>

					<strong>Finding 11.</strong> In the forum where we can view all posts, the characters in bold are given in between **char**, the ones in italics are given in between *char*, but when we read through the posts, they are shown in bold and italic as per their functionality. <strong>Recommendation:</strong> Use the same design throughout the entire system to maintain consistency. Show the characters in the forum also as bold and italics respectively.<br><br>

					<strong>Finding 12.</strong> Pinned posts on the discussion forum are also shown when a user searches for a particular word irrespective of whether it is relevant to the search word or not. <strong>Recommendation:</strong> Search results must only show posts or items relevant to the search.<br><br></p>

					<p class="headers"><strong>Heuristic Evaluation Report</strong></p>
					<p class="processflow">Once I had analyzed the interface of the discussion forum, jotted down the violations that I came across with the interface and prioritized the violations based on their severity, I wrote a research report to debrief my findings and provide suggestions to improve.</p>
